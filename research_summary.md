# Research Summary: WebSocket Performance and FlatBuffers

## WebSocket Performance Best Practices:

*   **Small TCP send/receive buffer sizes:** Tune the stack for many open slow connections, e.g., 4KB.
*   **SSL offloading:** Use reverse proxies/load balancers to handle TLS for secure WebSocket connections.
*   **Heartbeats:** Implement WebSocket heartbeats to maintain connections and detect disconnections.
*   **Error Handling:** Robust error handling is crucial for stable WebSocket applications.
*   **Connection Limits:** Limit the number of WebSocket connections per server to prevent overload.
*   **Authentication:** Authenticate WebSocket clients for troubleshooting, though it doesn't directly impact performance.
*   **Strongly typed languages and static compilation:** Languages like TypeScript, especially when compiled efficiently, can lead to superior performance due to type safety and reduced garbage collection overhead.

## FlatBuffers Integration for Performance:

*   **Zero-copy deserialization:** FlatBuffers allow reading data directly from a buffer without parsing or allocating additional memory, which is optimal for performance, especially with lightweight schemas.
*   **Optimized binary format:** FlatBuffers provide an efficient binary format that reduces data volumes and maximizes performance, particularly for WebSocket traffic.
*   **Cross-platform:** FlatBuffers support various languages, including TypeScript, making it suitable for both client and server implementations.

## µWebSockets.js (Implied from search results):

While direct information on µWebSockets.js architecture was not found in this initial search, the request implies it is a high-performance WebSocket library. The goal for SigmaSockets is to *outperform* it, suggesting that the focus should be on maximizing efficiency through binary protocols (FlatBuffers) and optimized WebSocket handling (reconnections, efficient buffer management, etc.).

## Key Takeaways for SigmaSockets:

*   Leverage FlatBuffers for all data serialization to achieve zero-copy deserialization and minimal data overhead.
*   Implement robust reconnection logic on both client and server.
*   Adhere to WebSocket best practices for performance and scalability (e.g., heartbeats, efficient buffer management).
*   Focus on a lean, raw Node.js implementation for the server to avoid framework overhead.
*   Ensure the TypeScript implementation is clean and avoids `any` or type casting to maintain type safety and performance benefits.
